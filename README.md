# **This project helps you debug object_detection using tensorflow eager excution model!**

1. The difference between train_for_eager_excution.py and origin train.py file is that the dataset object was replaced.
2. You can debug your ssd,faster,mask-faster using eager excution model as before,which is very convenient!
3. The usage of train_for_eager_excution.py is the same as the origin train.py file.
4. The inspect_tfrecord.py file helps you display the input image with bbox direct from coco tfrecord file.
